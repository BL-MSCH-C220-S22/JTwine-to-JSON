# JTwine-to-JSON
A story format for converting a Twine 2 story to JSON with special support for Harlowe 3.x. Specifically created for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University—Bloomington.

JTwine-to-JSON makes a few useful changes to [Twine-to-JSON](https://jtschoonhoven.github.io/twine-to-json/), which was inspired by [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison). Twison was, in turn, inspired by [Entweedle](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Entweedle/).

## Setup

From the Twine 2 homescreen, select Formats and then Add a New Format. At the prompt, paste in the address below:



## Export

Once you’ve installed format, enter your story and choose Change Story Format. Select the new format and return to your story. Selecting Play will export a JSON file.

From within your story, set the story format to Twison. Choosing “Play” will now give you a JSON file.
